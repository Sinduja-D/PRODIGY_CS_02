**Pixel Manipulation For Image Encryption** 

Pixel manipulation for image encryption and decryption involves altering the pixel values of an image to encode or hide information for secure communication. 

Here's an overview of how pixel manipulation can be used for image encryption and decryption:

**Image Encryption:**

_Pixel Transformation_: Encrypt the image by manipulating pixel values using techniques like substitution, permutation, or transformation algorithms.

_Key Generation_: Generate encryption keys to control the encryption process. These keys determine how the pixel values are transformed.

_Embedding Data_: Hide secret information within the image by altering pixel values based on the encryption algorithm and key.

**Image Decryption:**

_Pixel Reverse Transformation_: Decrypt the image by applying the reverse of the encryption algorithm to retrieve the original pixel values.

_Key Usage_: Use the decryption keys to reverse the encryption process and reveal the hidden information within the image.
